# ExploringODEsInJulia

As I work through the Book _Exploring ODEs_, which uses MatLab, I will by trying the excercises in Julia.

You can find the book here:

My point here is to help me learn about ODEs and learn some Julia. This means that I don't promise my answers are correct, merely that I think they are correct (or a work in progress). If I decide my answers are not correct, I will endevor to correct them unless I say otherwise. If you decide my answers are not correct, let me know so I can figure out what I did wrong - or try to explain why I think you are wrong.
